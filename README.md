# Regression Pipeline for Wine Quality Prediction

Individual group project - Course of Data Science Lab - Politecnico di Torino - 2020

Data Analysis and Machine Learning techniques to build an algorithm that outputs the overall quality of a wine, basing on its review, plus some other descriptive fields.

Dataset: edited version of winemag-data-130k. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christopheiv/winemagdata130

Techniques used: distribution exploration, correlation analysis, Bag-of-word representation (plus tokenization and stemming), One-Hot Encoding, sparse matrices handling, grid search, cross validation.

Model used: RIDGE Regressor, Fully-Connected Neural Network.

Final result: 0.865 R2-score.
